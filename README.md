**DeepOBS** is a benchmarking suite that drastically simplifies, automates and
improves the evaluation of deep learning optimizers.

It can evaluate the performance of new optimizers on a variety of
**real-world test problems** and automatically compare them with
**realistic baselines**.

DeepOBS automates several steps when benchmarking deep learning optimizers:

  - Downloading and preparing data sets.
  - Setting up test problems consisting of contemporary data sets and realistic
    deep learning architectures.
  - Running the optimizers on multiple test problems and logging relevant
    metrics.
  - Reporting and visualization the results of the optimizer benchmark.
