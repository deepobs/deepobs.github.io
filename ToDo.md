# ToDo Website

## Content

- [ ] Re-write the About DeepOBS section. Add more specifics (baselines!)
- [ ] Add link to Github more often (e.g. How to install and Open Source)

## Additional Content

- [ ] Write additional section about each test problem (setup, runtime, data set, etc.)
- [ ] Write some more details to each problem how it was gathered (mean of 10 runs, Hyperparameter optimization, etc.)
- [ ] Add a note that one can zoom into the Plots!
- [ ] Add Table with Hyperparameters, GitHub link, website link for each optimizer on each leaderboard-detail page? Like https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-cifar-10. Look into Datatables.net
- [ ] "Learn More" or similar button below the Fast/Fair/Comparable sections to go to e.g. Github page, Github page baselines, leaderboard?
- [ ] Add standard deviation to each plot in leaderboard. Make it hide/unhide together with the mean
- [ ] Images of data sets below each problem.
- [ ] Add more notes like "send us your optimizer".

## Design

- [x] Smooth Scrolling
- [ ] On Landing page make all leaderboard sections the same height (not true when scaling)!
- [ ] Increase width of main page content area for each detailed leaderboard. (Combine the results table and the hyperparameter table? How does it work on mobile/scaled windows?)
- [ ] Background color for each section (full width and height), like http://pyro.ai/, https://www.siteleaf.com/ or https://www.boxysuite.com/
- [ ] Change Color Scheme? (Haven't decided yet)
- [ ] High res DeepOBS Banner. Add some structure to the background, lines in color scheme of website? How can I make it scalable such that the lines on the right are always visible?
- [ ] Create a DeepOBS Banner with and without Text
- [ ] Create a Version of the Banner that is usable as a favicon

## Plots

- [ ] Replace Free Trial version with Student license
- [ ] Round the numbers shown in the tooltips.
- [ ] No markers for the std.dev when hovering over them.
- [ ] Pick a default zoom for the plots. Can you still zoom out then?
